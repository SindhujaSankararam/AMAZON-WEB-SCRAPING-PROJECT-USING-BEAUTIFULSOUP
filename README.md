# AMAZON-WEB-SCRAPING-PROJECT-USING-BEAUTIFULSOUP

This project involves the development of a Python script for web scraping Amazon product information.

The primary goal is to track and monitor the price fluctuations of a specific product on Amazon over time. 

The script utilizes web scraping techniques with BeautifulSoup to extract relevant data, which is then organized and stored in a CSV file. The automation aspect involves periodic checks of the product's price at predefined intervals, ensuring an up-to-date record of the product's pricing history.
